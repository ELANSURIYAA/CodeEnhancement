==================================================

## Summary of changes

**Deviation Detected:**
- File: DI_PySpark_Code_Update/RegulatoryReportingETL_Pipeline.py
- Type: Missing file
- Severity: Critical
- Description: The updated PySpark code file intended for review is missing from the repository (404 Not Found). As a result, no structural or semantic comparison can be performed.

### Categorization_Changes
- Structural: N/A (comparison not possible)
- Semantic: N/A (comparison not possible)
- Quality: N/A (comparison not possible)
- Severity: Critical (missing artifact blocks review)

### Additional Optimization Suggestions
- Ensure all required files are committed and available in the repository before initiating automated code reviews.
- Implement CI checks to verify existence of update/target files for review steps.
- Consider versioning or tagging updated files to avoid path or naming errors.
